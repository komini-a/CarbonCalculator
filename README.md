**CarbonCalculator**

Hello! This is one of my first attempts at creating a web-based project, and I’m excited to share it. CarbonCalculator is a small project I made alongside a few friends as a part of a club we created called Green Tech where we run project workshops. The goal for this project is to help myself and others learn more about web development and how technology can help people become more eco-friendly.

**What is CarbonCalculator?**

CarbonCalculator is a simple tool where users can input information about their C02 and energy usage and get an estimate of their carbon footprint. It’s our clubs first workshop project, so it's fairly simple, but it’s been a great learning experience.

**What I Learned**

- Using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build a basic website.
- Creating simple forms and calculations for user input.
- Understanding how to structure a basic web project.

**Future Improvements**

As our club expands and has more workshops, we plan to use similar principles but with more complex applications, building off of the basics gradually.
